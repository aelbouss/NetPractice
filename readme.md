# Netpractice Project

## introduction : 
netpractice is an important project that will introduce you to the word wide of computer networking, where youo will figure out a scaled networks and identify errors that prevent the connection between networks or devices and further how the connection between two devices occur.

  <summary>what is a network :</summary>
a network is a system of interconnected devices like computers that can connect to  each other and share data , this connection allows for information exchange and access shared rousources like (printers, files , applications), networks can range from small like home or office network to  large networks like the internet .

#### how the devices connected to each other in a network :
to build a network we nedd at least two devices and medium transmission either wired or wireless .
#### small network two devices connected via wire ethernet cable.

#### small network two devices connected via wireless signal WiFi.

**how  devices  communicate  with each other :**

- networks  enable devices  to  communicate  with  each other trough protocols  which are set of rules .

**resource sharing :**

- networks  can  provide  more  beyond  communication  between  devices  also  can provide resources  sharing like  printers  , files , applications . so  if  resources  sharing  enabled  in  the  network  all  the  devices  can  access and work  with  printer , application ..

**types  of  networks :** 

- actually  there are  many  types  of  networks but  the  most common  networks  are :

**LAN** : local area network  is a network  that  connecting  the  devices  withing a house or restaurant it coves a small  area just (house, office , coffeshop).  just a limited area .

**WAN** : wide area network is a network  that connecting devices over a large distance  like internet .

**the benefits  of  networks :** 

- the  networks  provide  many  benefits  like facilitating the connection between the devices and sharing  information also enabling the access to  shared  resources  from different locations .

**wireless networks vs  wired networks :**

**wired networks :** 

- fast
- more secure
- need a stable  place .
- more reliability .

**wireless networks :**

- covers many devices
- not depend on a specific place .
- mobility .
- flexibility .
- less reliability .
- slow compare to the wired one .
